        <h5>While completing my
            <span class="highlight">Master's degree in environmental policy</span>,
            I saw that emergency management seemed to focus more on response than prevention. Though mitigation was
            emphasized and funded, it was nearly always done so in response to some kind of natural diaster. In
            contrast, the <span class="highlight">software and data science</span> projects I took on focused on solving
            <span class="highlight">today's and tomorrow's problems efficiently</span>. As I took on increasingly
            complex projects in software engineering and data science, I was excited to grow into a position of
            <span class="highlight">leadership</span>, making decisions on
            overall <span class="highlight">architecture of applications</span>
            and <span class="highlight">mentoring colleagues</span> that are as passionate about software as I am.

            <br />
            <br />

            These days, I write in <span class="highlight">Go, Python, Bash, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</span>.
            My
            goal is to learn a new language every year by implementing it in a complex project in a way that makes
            sense. My favorite way to implement and deploy the code I write is through
            <span class="highlight">container systems</span>, such as <span class="highlight">Docker</span>. I find
            <span class="highlight">concurrency patterns</span> in Go to be the most interesting topic as of late,
            but also enjoy reading about and implementing
            <span class="highlight">big data solutions in the cloud</span>.

            <br />
            <br />

            Lately, I have been thinking about what role software could play in <span class="highlight">improving
                our public education system</span>,
            <span class="highlight">holding governments and politicians accountable</span>, <span
                class="highlight">making the stock market accessible to the public</span>,
            <span class="highlight">instilling general confidence in society</span>, and <span
                class="highlight">decreasing my mile time</span>.

            <br />
            <br />

            This year, I plan to...
            <ul>
                <li>learn <span class="highlight">1</span> new programming language</li>
                <li>build and deploy a <span class="highlight">new web application</span></li>
                <li>run <span class="highlight">1,000</span> miles</li>
                <li>read <span class="highlight">25</span> books</li>
                <li>beat all of the <span class="highlight"><i>Soulsbourne</i></span> video games</li>
            </ul>
